# Welcome to Todo-Less!

# Motivation

The inspiration for this app is Cal Newport's "time blocking" approach to "give every minute of the day a job."

I've noticed that my productivity skyrockets when I consciously plan my day and allocate specific hours for the tasks. Suddenly, I'm more focused and less prone to jump from task to task.

I've developed "todo-less" with this in mind: a minimalist, distraction-free environment to plan your day and get the job done.

# How to use it

## First

1. Set the starting time of your day (default is 9:00)

2. Add tasks, set their description, duration, and color code

3. Rearrange by dragging and dropping if you want to change the order

## While working

1. Mark tasks as completed by clicking the circle

2. If a task is taking more or less than previously expected, change its duration

3. You can also rearrange the order of the tasks by dragging and dropping

## When you finish

1. Click the "clear tasks" to delete all tasks

2. Plan your next day's tasks

# How to

- Add a new task: Click on the "Add a new task" button

- Edit a task: Click on the "v" arrow and click "Edit." Alternatively, double click on the task description

- Rearrange a task: click and hold to drag. On mobile, tap and hold

- Delete a task: Click on the "v" arrow and click "Delete." You can also delete a task from the "Edit" prompt

- Change starting hour: click on the "options" button and set a new starting hour

- Clear all tasks: click on the "clear all tasks" button
